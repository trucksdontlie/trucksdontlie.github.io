<h2 id="section1" class="big" ><span>Section1</span></h2>
<p> 
    Unions are the base of our strategy. These organizations have existed for over two centuries and are at the core of labor struggles. A mechanism of defense against the power relationship established between employer and employee. They have always been perceived as in clash with technological development, maintaining the status quo. We see them as an organization that fights for the rights of workers, not to preserve existing conditions, but to ensure prospects of employment and benefits accordingly. Not only for a pressured present, but for an unforeseeable future. Accordingly Unions are the obvious solution to a problem that engulfs: ensuring future incomes, distributed ownership and nodal network distribution. Unions have always operated as analogue networks and in the specific case of truck automation they must consolidate their organization to have the possibility of maintaining their share in the technological development of their industry.
</p>

<h2 id="section2" class="big" ><span>Section2</span></h2>
<p>
    These organizations have always been perceived as an agent of resistance against technological development. Since the industrial revolution they have often took upon that role on several occasions, not through sheer will, but because the technology seemed to pressure them into that situation. Automation was mostly used as a tool to reduce cost and replace workers. Requiring a heavy once-in-a-time capital intensive investment. The tools were mostly reflective of a centralized, capital intensive, structural condition. These technologies did not only disrupt the labor market, but also (maybe most importantly) created a strong polarization in it, exacerbating class struggle through sheer inequality. 
</p>

<h2 id="section3" class="big" ><span>Section3</span></h2>
<p>
    Technology and labor have always had a tumultuous relationship. In the 19th century with the advent of steam power, there was a large demand for unskilled workers through mechanization. The jump into Electricity from steam and water, created the beginning of an alarming disruption in the job market. On the one hand it generated a substantial amount of semi-skilled blue collar jobs that had to operate the electrified machinery, on the other it created white collar non-production workers. Basically decreasing the amount of blue collar jobs, “per factory” (so to say), but increasing the amount of job offerings overall through an increase in the expansion of the global economy. In the twentieth century the wage differential was relatively stable until the 80’s where the increase in skilled white collar labor accelerated because of capital-skill complementation and the rise of computers and information technology. In the last 4 decades the polarization expanded as the demand for low-skilled services and white collar highly skilled jobs grew, hollowing out semi skilled blue collar jobs, creating an overwhelming disparity in developed and developing economies alike. Inherent in this new technology, Ai, there is an opportunity to revert these trends and conflicts, especially in truck automation.
</p>

<p>
    With the potentiality of new technologies new struggles come into place as Andrew Ng puts it: “Whatever industry you work in Ai will probably transform it. Just as maybe about 100 years ago Electricity transformed industry after industry [...] I actually hope that whatever industry you’re in, that you figure out how to leverage Ai”. We believe that the difference with Ai, specifically in the case of truck automation, lends itself to leverage towards the popular side. Basically these new technologies are created to operate as a human being. To achieve this it needs to train on millions of samples, having already embedded in its structure a main decentralized aspect to it. If developed correctly through strong networked organizations, it could have great potential. Not only in spreading the economic incentives, also helping automate a job that is no longer desired.

</p>

<p>
    This is where we see the role of the union morphing, from being perceived as an organization of resistance, towards an organization of plural innovation. The technology requires countless hours of driving across the whole road network, the more one “feeds” hours of driving, the better it gets. If the union can create a large network of truck drivers and find a partnership with other entities it become a bastion that promotes technological innovation.. 
</p>

<p>
    In most parts of the world the model of ownerships of trucks is composed where the majority of trucks are owned by truck drivers. Therefore the relationship between logistical company fleets and trucks provided by truck drivers is imbalanced. This fact illuminates the potential for Ai, if the majority organized a coherent network, they could use their hours on the road to not only train Ai but to also amass a substantial amount of data on what type of products are delivered, what is the time span and the specific route taken. Once automation kicks in the organization could work as a decentralized capillary system perpetually surveying and informing, not only about the state of the infrastructure, but also the physical surroundings.
</p>

<p>
    The specific case study that we have been working with is the newly formed truck driver union in Russia, The OPR (http://www.opr.com.ru/).The organization started two years ago as a way to organize independent truck drivers against the newly imposed governmental toll on heavy duty trucks per kilometer called Platon (http://platon.ru/en/). This new imposition is meant to create a public/private partnership to improve the road infrastructure qualities across the territory, which are in terrible condition. The microeconomics of this toll-tax affects independent drivers the hardest. Big logistical companies with large fleets have the ability to diversify the cost due to their sheer scale.  Protesters don’t see this as a political issue, but more as an economic one. 
</p>

<p>
    Platon has seen increases throughout time. The last hike was supposed to be implement on March 1st but the state had to retreat on its incrementation due to the sheer manifestations growing across the country.A bottom up organization surged across the vast territory as hadn’t been seen in a long time. Mainly organized by communication through online platforms and diverse apps on their mobile phones (whatsapp, telegram and zello). This is where the importance of The OPR comes in. The union became more prominent as it helped establish and organize these protests, using the massive discontent of truck drivers to create a collective bargaining against an imposed tax. They are now on the mists of fighting against the Platon system all together. Slowly trying to avoid being pushed out by the big logistical companies
</p>

<p> 
    These last uprisings have been the largest workers strikes since the October Revolution, and The OPR sees the potential in organizing and creating a stronger network through this malcontent. This is where our first step of the strategy could help them create a stronger bond amongst them, providing other incentives to join the union as an independent truck driver.
