<h2 id="section1" class="big" ><span>Section1</span></h2>
<p> 
    Logistics is mostly concerned with the flows of goods, commodities and people. The industry has assisted our global economy in expanding and breaking apart from the constraints of space through time. In the last century global trade has increased at stunning rates as companies sought to separate geographically their manufacturing chain in efforts to reduce cost. Creating a highly efficient model of mobility during the last four decades, enabled mostly by technological progress that allowed for global connectivity. It operates as the backbone to our contemporary urban-centered society.
</p>

<h2 id="section2" class="big" ><span>Section2</span></h2>
<p>
    Logistics mostly operates on the “cost” side of economics, its ultimate goal is to be as optimal as possible in the reduction of capital spending. We have seen how companies such as Amazon [find other example] have had a surge in their productivity by the optimization in the efficiency of their logistical strategies. Giving them the possibility to reduce cost, thus being more competitive. This same model can be replicated at all scales of logistics, an industry that is based on the planning and coherence of time.

</p>

<h2 id="section3" class="big" ><span>Section3</span></h2>
<p>
    With the upsurge in technological progress this industry has been able to close its cost margin on global shipping to the point of almost 0. In order to be much more efficient with the movement of goods it has now optimized the major ports of the world to be completely autonomous. Worker intervention was reduced to its bare minimum. Knowing that through the relationship between mechanical “robots” and software, port infrastructure has become a highly complex system that can move things from different transportational mediums (ship to truck) at a much higher and faster rate. 
</p>

<p>
    The next phase of cost reduction is the also the next step in the supply chain, trucks. This is the part of the chain that renders itself most prone to inefficiencies and with the rise of e-retail worldwide, increase in flows and technological development, the most susceptible to automation. There has been a lot of hype in the media around self-driving cars, but automated trucks will have a monumental impact in our economy. In the US alone, there are 5.5 million trucks and its industry exceeds over 700 billion dollars. Two main industries are looking to disrupt it, seeking reduce costs and increase efficiency. These could be catalogued as hardware (OEM, original equipment manufacturers) and software (data and operating software companies). 
</p>

<p>
    As expressed above there are currently two main sides seeking to develop this technology, companies like Daimler, Volvo and Scania (OEM) and Uber Freight, Google (software). Most consultant reports highlight the importance of moving into the logistical business[1]. With the advent of technological development there seems to be a pivoting of the industries towards software centered logistical entities that could optimize for trading routes and time efficiencies. Seeking to cut out middlemen (logistical companies and brokers), through the use of communicational tools (apps) to access a more diverse supply of hauling businesses[2]. If they are able to combine this logistical services with a fleet of autonomous trucks, their revenue model would drastically change. Having most of the supplt chain transfer into a digital domain.
</p>

<p>
    When it comes to self driving vehicles, there are five main stages of automation [Insert diagram automation]. We are currently in a stage between two and three. In stages 3 and 4 there is still the need to have a human present to intervene in some specific cases (emergencies or to drive in dense urban areas). From stage 3 onwards, the driving is mostly done by the car, and the human acts as a tool of intervention, a hybrid relationship. OEM’s seek to disrupt the market of ownership of trucks by deploying their own fleet and hiring truck drivers as employees during stages three and four, changing the relationship between a driver and his means of production. When the possibility of stage five arrives (no human needed) truck drivers will have no economic relationship with the industry whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
    Most truck ownership markets in the global economy are composed by a majority of truck drivers/owners (independent drivers), in Russia, 70% of the market is composed by small entities that own between 1-3 trucks. Therefore the strategies stated above could produce catastrophic disruptions. 
</p>

<p>
    The issue with their strategy is one of timing. There are currently 1.7 million trucks in Russia 70% of that summed together is a very large amount of capital. If OEM’s are planning to disrupt the market any time soon, they would have to invest upfront a very large sum of money to meet the demand in the market. It could be spread through time, but that would still require such a vast amount that it would require a lot of trust from their shareholders.
</p>

<p> 
    Don’t know if to re explain how our Strategy could work as a counter anchor and then specify technical issues.
</p>

<p>
    There are several technical aspects that state the differences between the two strategies. Mainly it could be summed up as Lidar versus Cameras. Lidar is a laser technology that reconstructs its surroundings as a point cloud 3d model that allows to situate the vehicle in space, it has been the go-to technology for most of companies developing autonomous vehicles. It is also much less prone to error in comparison to an array of normal cameras (Dima’s input on why, conversation we had with my friend alex). The downside is that it is incredibly expensive (~25k U$S) and there doesn’t seem to be a viable way to lower its cost. A multitude of cameras on the other hand could be less expensive, the problem seems to be that the software is not there yet. Explain how companies have now pivoted to cameras as they see it as becoming less expensive. These companies are mainly ones that seek to sell retrofitting kits to cars that could allow some sort of tech ad hoc and convert a normal vehicle into a self driving one (OTTO).
</p>

<p>
    We think that down the road retrofitting will become a much more economic option than fully autonomous trucks. How will it play on our strategy and at which point in the strategy.
</p>

<p>
    With OEM’s and software companies developing this strategy comes great risk. They will centralize and absorb all of the liability. With our decentralized network the liability would be broken down, spread and push to the limit. -------> don’t know where to put this, but should go in somewhere
</p>

<p>
    Global trade exceeds 20 trillion dollars[3] and its most costly aspect of the supply chains is the truck.
